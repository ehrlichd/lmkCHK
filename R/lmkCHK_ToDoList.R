### To Do List


#### To do list for lmkCHK package, in no particular order.


################################
##### too many dependencies ####
#################################


# test on a clean install and see how long it takes/how many dependencies install.

# this package @imports too many packages. Figure out how to load just the packages it really needs?, surely some of them (jsonlite?) are not necesary. - Although, that may have been my own choice to update all dependencies present

############################
##### build splash page #####
#############################

# page to highlight simple features

# perhaps vignettes?


############################
##### refactor(?) pages #####

#possibly the wrong term, but create separate .R files for specific types of analysis (eg, screening for outliers, running analysis(not sure if this package actually does any of that), visualizing data)

# LMK_screen
# LMK_outliers
# LMK_obs-error

# some of the above could proably be combined

# LMK_Viz

# get all similar functions together
